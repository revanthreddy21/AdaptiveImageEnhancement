##  Overview
**Advanced Image Enhancement Suite** is a Python-based image enhancement tool that combines **advanced histogram techniques** with a modern Tkinter GUI.  
It allows users to improve image quality using **PDF enhancement**, **CDF enhancement**, **contrast adjustment**, **gamma correction**, and **multi-scale enhancement (CLAHE)** — all in a user-friendly interface.


##  Features
- **PDF Enhancement** – Adaptive Probability Density Function-based contrast improvement.
- **CDF Enhancement** – Adaptive Cumulative Distribution Function for better brightness distribution.
- **Contrast Adjustment** – Fine-tune image brightness and contrast.
- **Gamma Correction** – Adjust gamma for natural brightness perception.
- **Multi-Scale Enhancement** – Local histogram equalization using CLAHE.
- **Live Preview** – View original and enhanced images side-by-side.
- **Save Enhanced Images** – Export your processed results easily.
